# Flexera Policy Development - Initial Setup

In order to begin this training, you will need to install some local software tools. These same tools will be used for policy development proper.

For convenience, a separate setup guide is provided for each operating system. Please click the appropriate link to follow the guide for your OS. If you're not sure which option to select for Windows, it is recommended that you use PowerShell unless you're using Windows as an OS but are more comfortable with a Linux command line.

* [Windows (PowerShell)](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_engine_training/blob/main/00_setup/windows_powershell/README.md)
