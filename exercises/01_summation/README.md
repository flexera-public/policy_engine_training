# Flexera Policy Development - Exercise 01 - Summation

## Exercise

Create a new policy template with the name "Sum of Two Numbers". The file name can be anything you like. This policy template should take two parameters, each with the `type` field set to "number". The policy template should then add those numbers together and raise an incident with the sum of those two numbers. When you've finished the policy template, test it using the "fpt run" command and verify that it works.

When you've completed the exercise, or if you need help, you can review the [completed policy template in the "solution" directory](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_engine_training/blob/main/exercises/01_summation/solution/summation.pt). Note that your policy template may not look identical; there is more than one way to complete this exercise.
