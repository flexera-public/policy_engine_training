# Flexera Policy Development - Exercise 02 - Tutorial Policy Templates

## Exercise

Create a new policy template with the name "List Tutorial Policy Templates". The file name can be anything you like. This policy template should list all of the policy templates in the Flexera One organization whose "category" is equal to "Tutorial". The resulting incident should be emailed via an `escalation` block. When you've finished the policy template, test it using the "fpt run" command and verify that it works.

When you've completed the exercise, or if you need help, you can review the [completed policy template in the "solution" directory](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_engine_training/blob/main/exercises/exercises/02_tutorial_templates/solution/tutorial_templates.pt). Note that your policy template may not look identical; there is more than one way to complete this exercise.
